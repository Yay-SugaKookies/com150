Today, I was instructed to create three simple windows applications using visual basic. I forgot my flash drive, so imma upload my code on here. 

**PROGRAMS WITH THEIR FUNCTIONS:**

        circle: Finds the area of a circle after user inputs the radius.

        luck: Gives you 5 random numbers. The first number is red (because why not?)

        average: Finds the average of two numbers.
