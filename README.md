I forgot my flash drive today, so imma upload my visual basic code on here. Today, I was instructed to create three simple windows applications using visual basic. 

**PROGRAMS WITH THEIR FUNCTIONS**

        *circle*: Finds the area of a circle after user inputs the radius.

        *luck*: Gives you 5 random numbers. The first number is red (because why not?)

        *average*: Finds the average of two numbers.
