Today, I was instructed to create three simple windows applications using visual basic. I forgot my flash drive, so imma upload my code on here. 

**PROGRAMS WITH THEIR FUNCTIONS:**

        circle: Finds the area of a circle after user inputs the radius.

        luck: Gives you 5 random numbers. The first number is red (because why not?)

        average: Finds the average of two numbers.
        
        greater: Compares numbers and then tells you if the numbers are equal/greater to eachother in a message box
        
        OddsEvens: Tells you if you passed (greater than oe equal to 80) or failed (less than 80) in a message box
                
                The Odds Evens one was orignally supposed to be something else at first, but I was too lazy to change the name
        GrossPay: Calculates the gross pay when given the # of hours worked and the pay rate.
